📌 Week 1 — Engineering Mindset Bootcamp

🟦 DAY 1 — SYSTEM REVERSE ENGINEERING + NODE & TERMINAL

📖 Overview

This task focuses on understanding system-level concepts using Node.js and the Linux terminal.
The objective was to inspect system information, work with shell configuration, and log runtime metrics using Node.js.
The exercise builds foundational knowledge in:

System introspection
Terminal commands
Shell configuration
Node.js process metrics
Logging structured JSON output

🛠 Tech Stack
Node.js
Linux Terminal
Bash
Built-in Node modules (os, child_process, fs)

🟩 DAY 2 — Node CLI & Concurrency

📖 Overview

Built a production-style CLI tool using Node.js that performs file statistics analysis with concurrent processing and performance monitoring.
Bonus feature - Remove duplicates

🛠 Concepts Practiced
CLI argument parsing
File system operations
Async concurrency with: Promise.all
                        async/await
Performance measurement:process.hrtime()
                        process.memoryUsage()
Writing structured logs
